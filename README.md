Abstract: 
In this project we are tasked with the ability to use various datasets and perform classification or regression towards certain target values and optimize the performance of the model through testing the results. My project involves of using the Abalone dataset and do classification on the target value "Sex" while improving the prediction model to get better results. After several trial and errors, the most accurate model for me was the Linear Discriminant Analysis (lda) model which provided a couple accurate results for this prediction model.
